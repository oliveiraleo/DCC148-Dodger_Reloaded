# DCC148-Dodger_Reloaded

This game was presented as the second activity of the Games Development course (DCC148). It was part of the requirements to successfully complete the course.

## How to play

Your character (the green box) is alone. A lot of enemies (the red boxes) are coming to try to knock it.

Move your character wisely and try to stay alive for as long as you can, dodging from the enemies' bodies.
